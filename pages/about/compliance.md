# Compliance 

Compliance with the core MIxS is very easy – it only consists of **11** metadata items, and can be filled in very quickly prior to sequence submission to public databases.

Below are examples of MIxS compliant metadata lists for a genome sequence, a metagenomic sample, and a marker gene survey. They have varying degree of detail, but ultimately what makes them MIxS-compliant are the common items marked in bold red font.
