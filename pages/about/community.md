The GSC Community
===============

The Genomics Standards Consortium is a volunteeer organization made up of people who want to make genomic data more findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. There is no GSC membership per se, but individuals and organization can get involved by attending an annual meeting, following our Github repositories, or joining one of our mailing lists (see the Contact Us page), or contributing to the Compliance and Interoperabilty Group that maintains the MIxS standards. 

## Projects using GSC standards

The following projects are using GSC's stanards, included MIxS, MIGO, etc.. (need a better list):
- EBI
- JJDB

- more

If your project is using a MIxS standard and is not on this list, please let us know by creating an issue at (link to website issue tracker).

## Join the CIG
