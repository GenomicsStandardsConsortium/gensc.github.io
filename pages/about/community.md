The GSC Community
===============

The Genomics Standards Consortium is a volunteeer organization made up of people who want to make genomic data more findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. There is no GSC membership per se, but individuals and organization can get involved by attending an annual meeting, following our Github repositories, or joining one of our mailing lists (see the Contact Us page), or contributing to the Compliance and Interoperabilty Group that maintains the MIxS standards. 

## GSC standards adopters

The following organisations are actively using and promoting the use of GSC's stanards, included MIxS, MIGO, etc.:
