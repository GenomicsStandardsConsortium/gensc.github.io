# About GSC

## GSC Mission

Community-driven standards have the best chance of success if developed within the auspices of international working groups. Participants in the GSC include biologists, computer scientists, those building genomic databases and conducting large-scale comparative genomic analyses, and those with experience of building community-based standards.

The mission of the GSC is to work towards:

*   Making genomic data discoverable
*   Enabling genomic data integration, discovery and comparison through international community-driven standards
