# Join the GSC
The Genomics Standards Consortium is a volunteeer organization made up of people who want to make genomic data more findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. 
There is no GSC membership per se, as membership is defined by participation. Individuals and organization can get involved by attending an annual meeting, following our Github repositories, or joining one of our mailing lists (see below), or contributing to the Compliance and Interoperabilty Group that maintains the MIxS standards. 
To receive email updates, invitations to meeting, etc. please request to be added to the [google-group](https://groups.google.com/u/2/g/genomic-standards-consortium) where all general emails about GSC meetings and comunications are diseminated. 

In addition to the general mailing list, there are 2 working groups within the GSC, and both are always welcoming new members, whether that be for just a few sessions or more often, everyone can help. 

## Compliance and Interoperability Working Group (CIG)
The CIG meet on the 4th Tuesday of each month via Zoom. The primary function is to discuss, evaluate and implement changes and updates to any of MIxS checklists, packages or terms. The majority of the regular members to this group are biologists and no informatics skills are required.
This group has its own [gensc-cig google-group](https://groups.google.com/u/2/g/gensc-cig) where monthly meeting reminders are sent along with discussions on compliance and useage of the standards.

## Technical Working Group (TWG)
The TWG meet on the 2nd Tuesday of each month via Zoom. The primary function is to discuss, evaluate and implement changes and updates to the technological aspects of how the standards are implemented using LinkML. The majority of the regular members to this group are bioinformatician or IT people from other backgrounds and no biological knowledge is required.
