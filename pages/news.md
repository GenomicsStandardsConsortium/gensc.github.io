{% include header.html %}

Stub for News page.
Needs all information added and we need to create a complete archive of all old news items currently available on <https://gensc.org/gsc-blog/>

Ideally this page will auto update when new items are added to "/pages/news/" folder, but I have no idea how to do that in markdown!
