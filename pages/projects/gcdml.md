**Project Title** Genomic Contextual Data Markup Language (GCDML)

**Project Lead** Renzo Kottmann

**Team members** See: [http://wiki.gensc.org/index.php?title=GCDML](http://wiki.gensc.org/index.php?title=GCDML)

**Elevator pitch** The Genomic Contextual Data Markup Language (GCDML) is a core project of the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) that is a reference implementation of the “Minimum Information about any Sequence” (MIxS) specification in XML Schema.

**Project Summary** The Genomic Contextual Data Markup Language (GCDML) is a core project of the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) that implements the “Minimum Information about any Genome Sequence” . GCDML is an XML Schema for generating MIxS compliant reports for data entry, exchange, and storage. When This sample-centric, strongly-typed schema provides a diverse set of descriptors for describing the exact origin and processing of a biological sample, from sampling to sequencing, and subsequent analysis. GCDML is freely available, and can be downloaded, along with documentation, from the GSC Web site (http://gensc.org).

**Project Initiation Date** The project was a follow up of the first XML for the Genomes Catalogue as discussed from the very first meeting. Then it grew into an own project.

**What will this project aim to contribute to the GSC?** An XML schema as a reference implementation of the MIxS specification.

**Have you spoken about the project already within GSC?** GCDML was formalized at GSC 5 and existed as an XML schema since the earliest efforts of the GSC to build the GSC Genome Catalogue. It is one of the GSC core projects.

**Which existing projects, if any, does this one replace/complement/subsume/expand?** GCDML is the first reference implementation of the MIxS specification.

**How does this project fit into GSC’s mission statement?** Helps implementation and adoption of MIxS and information exchange.

**Will you start a GSC working group?** Formed: [http://wiki.gensc.org/index.php?title=GCDML](http://wiki.gensc.org/index.php?title=GCDML)

**How do you wish to further engage the GSC ?** GCDML is now primarily developed through the developer’s group.

**Do you already have a website or do you wish to create a home page for the project in the GSC website?** GSC website: [http://wiki.gensc.org/index.php?title=GCDML](http://wiki.gensc.org/index.php?title=GCDML)

**What other resources might you like from what the GSC can offer (mailing lists, etc)?** All needed resources already well established.

**What kind of timeline are you working to for building consensus, releasing a first version etc?** The timeline is synced with MIxS timeline of development.

**How is this work currently funded?** Funded through PhD work of Renzo Kottmann and volunteer activities within GSC. Currently no funding.

**What resources will be required for completion?** Current version complete. Documentation missing. Need of 2-6 Pm (FTE) to create full documentation and next version release.

**What are your current plans for publishing/promoting the project?** No plans currently.
