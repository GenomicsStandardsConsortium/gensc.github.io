# New Extension Proposal Template

This is the template for the description of a new GSC extension. Please copy and paste the points and provide your text in a google-doc (or similar) to be shared with the GSC-Compliance and Interoperability Group (GSC-CIG). 
Your description should be concise, but sufficiently detailed for members of the GSC and the wider community to understand the purpose of the extension, the group(s) proposing it, and its relationship to other already existing checklists and extensions. It should serve as a standalone description of the extension and it will (pending review by the GSC-CIG) be posted to a public GitHub repository as a project:


1.  **Proposed Extension Title:**
2.  **Proposers (name, email, institute(s)):**
    - **Lead:**
    - **Team members:**
3.  **Purpose of extension (Summary- two or three paragraphs of background, purpose and plans)**
4.  **Which existing checklists, if any, does this one replace/complement/subsume/expand?**
5.  **Explain briefly why this extension is needed (what gap does it fill?)**
6.  **Who will benefit from this extension?**
7.  **Which groups are already involved in its design?**
8.  **Which groups would you like to also involve in its design?**
9.  **Provide any other information you wish to share about this proposal with the GSC-CIG:**

Please send complete proposals to gensc-cig@googlegroups.community
