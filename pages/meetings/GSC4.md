eGenomics IV  6-8th June 2007
=============================

### General Information

The “eGenomics: Cataloguing our Complete Genome Collection IV” workshop is the third NIEeS funded workshop and the fourth workshop of the Genomic Standards Consortium GSC. This workshop will be a mix of short presentations and group discussions which will build heavily on the roadmap developed at the 3rd GSC workshop held at NIEeS in Sept 2006. 

The Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) is an initiative working towards richer descriptions of our collection of genomes and metagenomes.  Established in September 2005, after an exploratory workshop hosted by NIEeS, the goal of this international community is to promote mechanisms for standardizing the description of genomes and the exchange and integration of genomic data.  Genomic and metagenomic sequencing projects are being completed at a rapid pace that will only increase as the application of ultra-high-throughput methods becomes commonplace.  The primary aim of developing a new standard is to ensure that those researchers generating genomes and metagenomic contribute to an increase in the quality and quantity of metadata, so that interpretation and analyses of the genome collection can be carried out in a comprehensive and unhindered manner, especially from an ecological and environmental perspective.  More background information about the GSC can be found at its [website](http://gensc.org).

This meeting is being co-organised by Dawn Field, George Garrity, Frank Oliver Glöckner, Tanya Gray, and Tatiana Tatusova

### Aim of the meeting

This 4th workshop of the Genomic Standards Consortium GSC will be a mix of short presentations and group discussions which will build heavily on the roadmap developed at the 3rd GSC workshop held at NIEeS in Sept 2006.
