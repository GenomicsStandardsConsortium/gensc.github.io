Purpose
-------

**Brief Description**

  
The aim of the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) is to support the community-based development of a genomic standard that captures a richer set of information about complete genomes and metagenomic datasets.

  
An introduction to the GSC will be given, together with an open discussion concerning topics of relevance to the GSC. For further information, please visit: [http://gensc.sf.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20080517222136/http://gensc.sf.net/ "http://gensc.sf.net")

  
The purpose of the BoF is to provide an introduction to the GSC and its activities, and to describe some of the issues relevant to the GSC. It will provide an opportunity for GSC members to meet each other as well as people interested in the work of the GSC.

Agenda

**Emailed responses:**

**Dawn Field**

I will be there too, and I'm glad to see it will be Saturday. My main commitment is the micro-SIG on comparative microbial genomics the day before - I will talk about our work with QIPP but will mention the GSC and can advertise the BoF as well.

[http://micro-sig.lbl.gov/](https://web.archive.org/web/20080517222136/http://micro-sig.lbl.gov/ "http://micro-sig.lbl.gov/")

I could send an announcement of the BoF to the speakers in that session once you have further details.

  
**Robert Stevens**

I shall be there, keen to attend and my only duties are chairing the Ontology and Db session (and I haven't looked to see when it is). I'm also doing some kind of feedback session for the bio-ontologies SIG on Sunday.

I'm always happy to talk about "what does it all mean anyway?".

  

**Susanna-A Sansone**

I would be there on friday (when is the Bio-Ontology SIG), but am free on saturday, in case that would be the chosen day.

  
**Lynette Hirschman**

I will be at ISMB and would be happy to participate -- and if anyone wants to talk about text mining (or to hear about what we discussed), I could say about 5 min worth on that or contribute a couple slides to an overview.

  
**Renzo Kottmann**

I will attend the BOF and would like a day as early as possible.

  
**Tatiana Tatusov**

I'll be at the meeting and will be interested in attending BoF. I can lead some of the discussions either on genome annotation or on metagenomics

  
**Peter Dawyndt**

I will be at the ISMB/ECCB an surely am interested to attend the meeting. Hideaki Sugaware (DDBJ) will also be there, and also informed me on the fact that he would be interested to attend the meeting.

...

if we want to reach out to the user community, the best aproach is a hybrid between a general presentation of the GSC and its different goals, followed by a round table discussion. What could also help is a short background paper that summarizes the activities of the GSC. After all, the ISMB/ECCB BoF gives a chance to inform people that have never heard of the GSC whatsoever.
