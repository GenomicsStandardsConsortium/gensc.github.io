# 1st "Exploratory" Genomics Standards Consortium Workshop==

**Date:** 7-9 September, 2005

**Venue:** National Institute for Environmental e-Science, Cambridge, UK

**Organizers:** Dawn Field and Tatiana Tatusova

This exploratory workshop was organized by Dawn Field and Tatiana Tatusova to discuss the need for a new genomic standard. The invited speakers were brought together to help achieve three major goals at the workshop, namely, to identify the science questions driving the need for more metadata, to look for ways to harmonize existing and future efforts at metadata capture, and to develop a more detailed vision of the shape a new standard might take. More specifically, it was hoped that the group would use this opportunity to discuss features for inclusion in the draft checklist, discuss potential mechanisms for capturing and exchanging metadata, and discuss how the community might organize itself to make such a standard a reality. By the end of the meeting, consensus was reached that such a standard should evolve and this group accepted responsibility for doing so. As a result of this workshop, the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) was formally established.

Many thanks to NIEeS for funding and hosting the event and to the participants for talks and discussions.
