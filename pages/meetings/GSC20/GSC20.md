**Air Travel, Ground Transportation, and Visas**

VISA WAIVER COUNTRIES  
Citizens of countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program do not need to apply for visas to attend the Workshop. You may enter the United States using just your passports and your Workshop Registration Notice. At the port of entry into the U.S, please request to be given a “Visa Waiver for Business” (WB) status. That will allow you to stay in the U.S. for the length of the Conference.  
IMPORTANT: Effective January 12, 2009, all Visa Waiver travellers will be required to obtain an authorization via ESTA before traveling to the United States: [https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/).

NON-VISA WAIVER COUNTRIES  
Citizens of countries not participating in the Visa Waiver Program will need to request a Business (B-1) visa at the nearest U.S. Consulate. Please present at the Consulate your Workshop Registration Notice, along with your valid passport. We urge you to do this EARLY, as there are often delays in this process. Official letters of invitation (without financial commitment) to help overcome administrative difficulties in some countries can be sent upon written request to the conference administrator.
