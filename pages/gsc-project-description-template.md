# GSC Project Description Template

This is the template for the description of all GSC projects. Please copy and paste the points and fill in your text. Your description should be concise, but sufficiently detailed for members of the GSC and the wider community to understand the purpose of the project, the leads, the participants, future plans, and relationship to other projects. It should serve as a standalone description of the project. GSC members largely use Google Docs to develop the text of their descriptions as a group before they are formally posted to the website here. New projects can be added at any time.

1.  **Project Title**
2.  **Project Lead (s) (name, email, institute(s))**
3.  **Team members (name, email, institute(s))(those introducing and leading the project in the initial phases)**
4.  **Elevator pitch (20 – 50 words)**
5.  **Project Summary (two or three paragraphs of background, purpose and plans)**
6.  **Project initiation date (can be a date or a narrative about how and when the project started and how it is proceeding)**
7.  **What will this project aim to contribute to the GSC?**
8.  **Have you spoken about the project already within GSC? (on a call, at a formal GSC meeting, would like to request time to present at a future meeting).**
9.  **Which existing projects, if any, does this one replace/complement/subsume/expand? Explain briefly why an extra project is needed/justified (what gap does it fill?)**
10.  **How does this project fit into GSC’s mission statement (might also expand it)?**
11.  **Will you start a GSC working group (how far along are you?)? If not, why not (i.e. subgroup within developers group, existing external community, etc)**
12.  **How do you wish to further engage the GSC (recruit members to project, get consultation, link to other GSC projects, etc)?**
13.  **Do you already have a website or do you wish to create a home page for the project in the GSC website (GSC maintains an open wiki at present, all working groups have a page)?**
14.  **What other resources might you like from what the GSC can offer (mailing lists, etc) ?**
15.  **What kind of timeline are you working to for building consensus, releasing a first version etc**
16.  **How is this work currently funded (list grants, funders, in kind contributions, etc)?**
17.  **What resources will be required for completion (funding, manpower, etc.)? (This question is just to give an idea about the size of the project)**
18.  **What are your current plans for publishing/promoting the project?**
19.  **References or relevant websites (for further reading)**
