FYI- CIH made the executive decision that the dinky theme was the nicest of those supported by GitHub, so thats what I chose to use. If a different one is preferred by the majority, then its easy to change in the _config.yml file.

1. I've been having issues with the relative paths of links, some work some dont! I need some help getting those all right.
2. The News items are too numerous to do manually, I need some help pulling those all into the github repo in markdown format.[#10](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/gensc.github.io/issues/10)
3. The "News" page should build automatically from the top 1-3(?) newest items added to the /pages/news/ directory, with a list of all other news item links [#7](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/gensc.github.io/issues/7)
4. None of the projects pages have been imported yet [#8](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/gensc.github.io/issues/8)
5. The checklist pages will need to be generated from the MIxS repo, I have no idea how to do that.[#11](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/gensc.github.io/issues/11)
6. Past meetings pages have not yet been imported.[#9](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/gensc.github.io/issues/9)
7. None of the wiki pages have been imported (https://wiki.gensc.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) these pages are not working so not sure how to get anything useful from them?
8. There are some documents included i the MIxS repo wiki too that we might want to include https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/wiki/1.-Background ?
