The (provisional) themes of the conference will be: "Genomic Standards for Precision Medicine, Agriculture, Comparative Genomics, and Metabolomics"

The [GSC23-Bangkok Meeting Page](https://genomicsstandardsconsortium.github.io/GSC23-Bangkok/) is live, and will be updated with new details as they become available.

This meeting is intended for professionals within the fields of medical genomics, agriculture, comparative genomics, and metabolomics tackling metadata challenges related to the sample collection, processing and genomic sequencing workflow critical for small and large scale datasets. It is our intention to discuss and plan for evolving genomic and laboratory standards to address the needs of the clinical, academic and industry researchers with a focus on precision medicine and agriculture.
