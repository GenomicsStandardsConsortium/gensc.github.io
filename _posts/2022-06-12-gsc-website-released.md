The GenSC.org website is now served from GitHub
=======================================================

The GenSC.org website has been moved from the old wordpress version that was no longer being maintained to the GitHub environment along with the new version of the standards (v6) recently released.
The Genomic Standards Consortium will maintain the site collaboratively which should mean more frequent updates to the website with relevant information as well as allowing a greater transparency as is appropriate for an open standards organisation such as this.
Please feel free to provide feedback via the GitHub ticketing system if you see any mistakes/typos or things that need to be changed in the website, or if you have suggestions for improvments and additions.
We welcome input from everyone.
