Genomic Observatories Metadatabase
==================================

Posted on August 14, 2017 7:12 am by Pelin Yilmaz.

Check out the [GeOMe repositor](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002925)y, great work by our GBWG colleagues! The Genomic Observatories Metadatabase (GeOMe, [http://www.geome-db.org/](http://www.geome-db.org/)) is an open access repository for geographic and ecological metadata associated with biosamples and genetic data. Whereas public databases have served as vital repositories for nucleotide sequences, they do not accession all the metadata required for ecological or evolutionary analyses. GeOMe fills this need, providing a user-friendly, web-based interface for both data contributors and data recipients. The interface allows data contributors to create a customized yet standard-compliant spreadsheet that captures the temporal and geospatial context of each biosample. These metadata are then validated and permanently linked to archived genetic data stored in the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s (NCBI’s) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) via unique persistent identifiers. By linking ecologically and evolutionarily relevant metadata with publicly archived sequence data in a structured manner, GeOMe sets a gold standard for data management in biodiversity science.
