# Slot: votu_class_appr


Cutoffs and approach used when clustering new UViGs in “species-level” vOTUs. Note that results from standard 95% ANI / 85% AF clustering should be provided alongside vOTUS defined from another set of thresholds, even if the latter are the ones primarily used during the analysis
