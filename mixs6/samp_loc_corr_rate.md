# Slot: samp_loc_corr_rate


Metal corrosion rate is the speed of metal deterioration due to environmental conditions. As environmental conditions change corrosion rates change accordingly. Therefore, long term corrosion rates are generally more informative than short term rates and for that reason they are preferred during reporting. In the case of suspected MIC, corrosion rate measurements at the time of sampling might provide insights into the involvement of certain microbial community members in MIC as well as potential microbial interplays
